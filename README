This is a module written in lua, which allows to monitor the weather
in almost any arbitrary city according to the information provided by
http://pogoda.yandex.ru .

USAGE

1. Unpack this archive to your awesome configuration directory.

2. Add the following line to the beginning of your rc.lua file:

	require("weather")

3. Create a textbox or imagebox widget, for example:

	myweatherwidget = widget({ type = "textbox" })

	--or widget({ type = "imagebox" })

4. Then visit the page of your city on http://pogoda.yandex.ru .
The URL should be something like "http://pogoda.yandex.ru/xxxxx/"
Remember these "xxxxx" :)

5. After that, in your rc. lua file, call the following function with
appropriate arguments:

	weather.addWeather(myweatherwidget, "xxxxx", timeout)

The default city code is the code of Moscow.
The default timeout for widget updating is 907 seconds.

6. Remember to put your widget into some suitable wibox ;)

Left-clicking on the widget will force it to update data immidiately.

You may create any number of widgets monitoring weather in different
cities (or even in the same one, if you want to see, for example, either
current t° in text format either wonderful shiny picture illustrating
the сurrent weather state).

Just note that you can't associate more than one city with a single
widget: it will accept the city code only for the first time the
"addWeather()" function is called.
